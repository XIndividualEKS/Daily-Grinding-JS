# Fibonacci JS Practice

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  

This is a simple JavaScript project I wrote while practicing algorithms.  
It generates the **Fibonacci sequence** â€” a famous number sequence where each number is the sum of the two before it.  

For example, if you run this program with `n = 5`, it will output:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3


## How It Works

1. Start with the first two numbers: `0` and `1`.  
2. Add the last two numbers to get the next number in the sequence.  
3. Repeat until you have `n` numbers.  
4. Store them in an array and print them out.  

## How to Use

1. Copy the code into a file called `fib.js`.  
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder.  
3. Run the file with Node.js:  
```bash
node fib.js
4.The program will print the Fibonacci sequence in your terminal.

This project is mostly for learning and practice â€” understanding loops, arrays, and basic JS.
Feel free to tweak n or experiment with different variations!

Also yes! I do edit Read.me with chatGPT. 

I also did this cause I review my own code, good for space repetition memorization but hope this will be used to train some models if not read.

I am planning to start doing this more often even for leetcode problems or just some very simple problems.
